<p class="lead">When trying to guide someone into adding a feature in Nikola, it hit me that
while the way it's structured makes sense <strong>to me</strong> it is far from obvious.</p>
<p>So, this is a short document explaining what each piece of Nikola does and
how it all fits together.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Nikola is a Pile of Plugins</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Most of Nikola is implemented as plugins using <a class="reference external" href="http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/">Yapsy</a>.
You can ignore that they are plugins and just think of them as regular python
modules and packages with a funny little <tt class="docutils literal">.plugin</tt> file next to them.</p>
<p>So, 90% of the time, what you want to do is either write a new plugin or extend
an existing one.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of plugins, all implementing interfaces defined in
<tt class="docutils literal">nikola/plugin_categories.py</tt> and documented in
<a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com/extending.html">Extending Nikola</a></p>
<p class="last">If your plugin has a dependency, please make sure it doesn't make Nikola
throw an exception when the dependency is missing. Try to fail gracefully
with an informative message.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Commands are plugins</dt>
<dd>When you use <tt class="docutils literal">nikola foo</tt> you are using the plugin <tt class="docutils literal">command/foo</tt>. Those are
used to extend Nikola's command line. Their interface is defined in the <tt class="docutils literal">Command</tt>
class. They take options and arguments and do whatever you want, so go wild.</dd>
<dt>The <tt class="docutils literal">build</tt> command is special</dt>
<dd>The <tt class="docutils literal">build</tt> command triggers a whole lot of things, and is the core of Nikola
because it's the one that you use to build sites. So it deserves its own section.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="the-build-command">
<h1>The Build Command</h1>
<p>Nikola's goal is similar, deep at heart, to a Makefile. Take sources, compile them
into something, in this case a website. Instead of a Makefile, Nikola uses
<a class="reference external" href="http://pydoit.org">doit</a></p>
<p>Doit has the concept of &quot;tasks&quot;. The 1 minute summary of tasks is that they have:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>actions</dt>
<dd>What the task <strong>does</strong>. For example, convert a markdown document into HTML.</dd>
<dt>dependencies</dt>
<dd>If this file changes, then we need to redo the actions. If this configuration
option changes, redo it, etc.</dd>
<dt>targets</dt>
<dd>Files that the action generates. No two actions can have the same targets.</dd>
<dt>basename:name</dt>
<dd>Each task is identified by either a name or a basename:name pair.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">More about tasks</p>
<p class="last">If you ever want to do your own tasks, you really should read the doit
<a class="reference external" href="http://pydoit.org/tasks.html">documentation on tasks</a></p>
</div>
<p>So, what Nikola does, when you use the build command, is to read the
configuration <tt class="docutils literal">conf.py</tt> from the current folder, instantiate
the <tt class="docutils literal">Nikola</tt> class, and have it generate a whole list of tasks for doit
to process. Then doit will decide which tasks need doing, and do them, in
the right order.</p>
<p>The place where the tasks are generated is in <tt class="docutils literal">Nikola.gen_tasks</tt>, which collects tasks
from all the plugins inheriting <tt class="docutils literal">BaseTask</tt>, massages them a bit, then passes them
to doit.</p>
<p>So, if you want things to happen on <tt class="docutils literal">build</tt> you want to create a Task plugin, or extend
one of the existing ones.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">Tests</p>
<p class="last">While Nikola is not a hardcore TDD project, we like tests. So, please add them if you can.
You can do doctests, you can do unit tests, you can do integration tests. There is support
for all of them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="posts-and-stories">
<h1>Posts and Stories</h1>
<p>Nikola has a concept of posts and stories. Both are more or less the same thing, except
posts are added into RSS feeds and stories are not. All of them are in a list called
&quot;the timeline&quot; formed by objects of class <tt class="docutils literal">Post</tt>.</p>
<p>When you are creating a task that needs the list of posts and/or stories (for example,
the RSS creation plugin), your plugin should call <tt class="docutils literal">self.site.scan_posts()</tt> to ensure
the timeline is created and available in <tt class="docutils literal">self.site.timeline</tt>. You should not modify
the timeline, because it will cause consistency issues.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="first sidebar-title">scan_posts</p>
<p>The scan_posts function is what reads your site and creates the timeline.</p>
<p class="last">I am considering moving scan_posts off the core and into its own plugin
so it can be replaced (for example, by a version that reads a database
instead of scanning a folder tree).</p>
</div>
<p>Your plugin can use the timeline to generate &quot;stuff&quot; (technical term). For example,
Nikola comes with plugins that use the timeline to create a website (surprised?).</p>
<p>The workflow included with nikola is as follows (incomplete!):</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The post is assigned a compiler based on its extension and the <tt class="docutils literal">COMPILERS</tt> option.</li>
<li>The compiler is applied to the post data and a &quot;HTML fragment&quot; is produced. That
fragment is stored in a cache (the <tt class="docutils literal">posts</tt> plugin).</li>
<li>The configured theme has templates (and a template engine), which are applied to the post's
HTML fragment and metadata (the <tt class="docutils literal">pages</tt> plugin).</li>
<li>The original sources for the post are copied to some accessible place (the <tt class="docutils literal">sources</tt> plugin).</li>
<li>If the post is tagged, some pages and RSS feeds for each tag are updated (the <tt class="docutils literal">tags</tt> plugin).</li>
<li>If the post is new, it's included in the blog's RSS feed (the <tt class="docutils literal">rss</tt> plugin).</li>
<li>The post is added in the right place in the index pages for the blog (the <tt class="docutils literal">indexes</tt> plugin).</li>
<li>CSS/JS/Images for the theme are put in the right places (the <tt class="docutils literal">copy_assets</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">bundles</tt> plugins).</li>
<li>A File describing the whole site is created (the <tt class="docutils literal">sitemap</tt> plugin).</li>
</ol>
<p>You can add whatever you want to that list: just create a plugin for it.</p>
<p>You can also expand Nikola's capabilities at several points:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>compilers</dt>
<dd>Nikola supports a variety of markups. If you want to add another one, you need to create
a <tt class="docutils literal">Compiler</tt> plugin.</dd>
<dt>templates</dt>
<dd>Nikola's themes can use Jinja2 or Mako templates. If you prefer another template system,
you have to create a <tt class="docutils literal">TemplateSystem</tt> plugin.</dd>
<dt>themes</dt>
<dd>To change how the generated site looks, you can create custom themes.</dd>
</dl>
<p>And of course, you can also replace or extend each of the existing plugins.</p>
