PyCon Argentina 2009, finished!
===============================

(disclaimer: there's a Spanish version of this mail in my blog [0]... If you
read Spanish I encourage you to go there because not only it's better written,
but also images and links are as they should be, not footnotes)

Ok, after so much foreplay and expectations, we finally had PyCon Argentina
2009, the first Spanish-spoken Python National Conference.

My idea here is not comment how the event was from an end user point of
view, but try to transmit feelings, thoughts and ideas about the
organizing/executing side.

Event Format
------------

The event was during two days, morning and afternoon, with three tracks in
parallel most of the time. We used three auditoriums with different
capacities (the biggest with 300 seats).  Presentations were of the
following types:

Talks: They happened in the three auditoriums, with national speakers
mostly, always in Spanish. Also there were some cases with most of one
speaker, like a panel. The assigned time was 40 minutes, plus 5 of Q&A.
After each talk, we left 15 minutes for people to go to the bathroom or
another auditorium.

Lightning Talks: These are 5-minutes talks. Anybody can give one of these
(people writes their names in a paper during both days), with no
restrictions in the subjects.  Normally you don't expect too much quality
of these talks (because they're fast, and tend to be improvised), but
having 10-12 different subjects in only one hour makes it valuable.  For
these talks, all people seat in the main auditorium.

Plenaries: We had two plenary talks (in the main auditorium, with all the
assistant public, the whole hour), that were given by two international
invitees: Jacob Kaplan-Moss (creator of Django [1], one of the web
frameworks most widely used in the world), and Collin Winter (Unladen
Swallow [2] developer, a Google project that promises a Python 5 times
faster than the actual one).

Team Organization
-----------------

Python Argentina does not have any formal or informal structure, we're
all peers and each one pushes the project that wants.

In this particular project, I structured the working team according to a
military hierarchic organization (the same used in the enterprises).
Basically I was the General Coordinator of the event, had a second person
of trust (one person that you fully trust, not only about which decisions
he/she makes, but also how he/she execute them; in this case he was
Alejandro Cura), a team of about 6-8 people, and a lot of more eventual
collaborators, with more or less participation (helping in the conference
days, or in different committees, etc.).

The most important requirement for a successful participation in the
organization, taking into account that we're all volunteers, is to comply
with what promised, no matter if the task is big or trivial.  If you
say "I'll do it", *do it*.

The kind of work that is done throughout the year is very different than
the work done during the conference days.  During the year the response
time is a lot lower, you need to take decisions that are influent in the
long term but can be discussed in several talks or meetings, etc.  During
the conference days, the decisions are taken and executed at the moment,
and there's no time to doubt. Generally, the better work done during the
year, the conference days will be smoother, with less surprises.

Risks
-----

There are several important tasks that take a lot of time and bring risks to
the conference organization:

The place where the conference is done, and the services offered there.  In
our case the conference was hosted in a private University, to whom we payed
for different concepts (internet, security, sound).  We've been talking with
them since April about all that was needed, but a lot of stuff happened too
close to the conference date. In particular, the internet access was
installed the previous afternoon. Luckily, we had the volunteer service of
Buenos Aires Libre [3], organization that set up the WiFi access, which
was excellent.

Printing. Beyond the paper stuff that we printed or photocopied (ads, polls,
etc), we had three big things to print: the program of the event (a 32 pages
book, full color), the Python tutorials in Spanish (116 pages book), and
some Canonical notebooks.  The design of each thing takes a lot of time, and
also takes time to print them.  I saw in too many conferences the mistake of
sending everything to print too close to the final date, and always there's
something that is not ready for the conference.  It's always important to
speak with the printing people in advance, and involve them in the design,
to minimize later surprises.

Financial and economical aspects.  Months before the conference we created
three different budgets, that we'd execute one way or the other according
to the funds raised later (and based on these budgets we defined the
sponsors categories).  Luckily we didn't have to knock any door to raise the
money: all the sponsors were brought by people that is in Python Argentina
(because they work in (or own) the companies that sponsored the event). There
are two important points: one is that the budget must be designed in levels,
to maximize the benefit for the conference if you can not raise all the money;
the other is that you need to start collecting the money as soon as possible,
because spending the money (say, execute the budget) is not trivial and takes
longer than you may think.

Technical infrastructure for the organization.  There are several tools that
we used for us organizers to work together.  We had a wiki to keep everything
annotated, a mail list as the main information exchange mechanism, and IRC
for some non-physical meetings that we had (especially for the talk selection,
where participated a lot of people that live in other cities).  We also used
a SVN repository to keep all the files, specially the web site files.  For
the web site of the event we used pycon-tech [4], a project thought for
this kind of events.

The team.  This is one of the main risks, because if you don't get a group
with people that tries to achieve the same goal, that wants to get together
and work towards a common target, it may happen that the event is not well
organized just because of the organizers themselves.  It's important to
understand that in a conference organized by volunteers, it may be people
that starts in the organization and then quits, or that people may jump
into the wagon later.  And the team is one of the first things you need to
define! This is why is critical that the General Coordinator of the event
to have enough power in the community to have a team assembled and working
together during all the months that take to prepare the event.

Generally, is recommended to do what you know how to do, and ask help to
(or hire) specialists in the cases where you don't have the needing knowledge
or resources.  For example, the event wifi was set up and operated by
Buenos Aires Libre, the same team that handled the wireless network in
Wikimania 2009.

After all said, however, you may find that there are problems you can not
prevent or mitigate: the first day of the conference the electricity went out
in all the neighbor.  Some talks continued in a dark room for a while, and
then we all went to have lunch, and lights came two minutes before the
afternoon session started...

Content
-------

The content is determined by the plenaries and normal talks, because the
lightning talks don't go through the decision of the organizing team.

For the international invitees plenaries, normally you choose the invitee
and give him/her total freedom about what to say. In our case, the selection
was done together with PyCon Brazil, and it was amazingly well done.

On the other hand, for the normal talks, a Call for Talks is done some
months in advance, and after the presentation limit date, a committee gets
together to discuss which talks will be chosen.  This selection is based
on the talk quality, and in the subjects that need to be represented during
the conference.

Social Aspects
--------------

One point that you need to take care and pay attention in the conference is
its social side.  A National Conference is a very good opportunity for
people to get together, see each other again after some time, exchange
ideas and knowledge, etc.

The evenings after each day of conference is a good moment for people to
have dinner or some drinks together, and make this social encounter happen.

In our case, we wanted to make this deeper by organizing an asado [5] on
the Sunday after the conference, to which all speakers and organizers were
invited, with their families.  The goal here is to enjoy a relaxed day
together, eat good meat (or vegetables!), have a glass of wine, talk, play
some games, etc.
