<h1 class="title">How-to get decimal.py if I have Python 2.3.x</h1>
<div class="document" id="how-to-get-decimal-py-if-i-have-python-2-3-x">
<p>This texts explains how to obtain a suitable archive file for
installation of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal</span></tt> with Python 2.3.x.  Companion file
README explains how to perform the installation if the archive you
download doesn't do everything for you, and also contains other
useful information and pointers.</p>
<p>Module <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal.py</span></tt> already comes with the standard Python 2.4 and
newer versions; in these cases you don't need to download it
separately.  Note that decimal is not officially supported for Python
2.2 and older versions -- if you're into archaeology, you're on your
own!</p>
<div class="section" id="downloading-the-necessary-files">
<h1><a name="downloading-the-necessary-files">Downloading the necessary files</a></h1>
<p>You can make either of two different choices here: download a module
installer archive file, or download the files separately.</p>
<p>In the first case, the procedure is simple, but maybe you won't get the
latest version. In the second case, the procedure has more steps, but
you'll be sure of getting the module latest version.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-the-installer">
<h2><a name="using-the-installer">Using the installer</a></h2>
<p>Go to <a class="reference" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sigefi">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sigefi</a>, to the file releases
section, and choose the package type to download:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal-x.x.win32.exe</span></tt>: Windows only.</li>
<li><tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal-x.x-x.rpm</span></tt>: For RPM based Linux distributions.</li>
<li><tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal-x.x.tar.gz</span></tt>: The simplest and most general (should work
whatever the platform on which you have Python 2.3 installed).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, just execute the installer. In the second case, do
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">rpm</span> <span class="pre">-i</span> <span class="pre">decimal-x.x-x.rpm</span></tt> as <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">root</span></tt>.</p>
<p>In the third case, also as <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">root</span></tt>, in any shell/command window, unzip
and untar the package, cd to the directory thus created, and execute
the installer -- for example, on a typical Linux or Unix installation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ gunzip decimal-x.x.tar.gz
$ tar -xf decimal-x.x.tar
$ cd decimal-x.x
$ su [[ enter password appropriately when requested ]]
# python setup.py install
# [[ close the root session with Ctrl-D ]]
$
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, if your machine is set up appropriately, instead of su
followed by the execution of the installer and then the exit from the
root session, you can mode compactly use <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span></tt> (again, you may have
to enter your password appropriately if sudo asks you for it):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo python setup.py install
</pre>
<p>This assumes that Python 2.3 is the one found as <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">python</span></tt> on your
PATH.  Otherwise, equivalently, enter a complete path to it, such as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sudo /weirdly/placed/python2.3 setup.py install
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downloading-the-files-separately">
<h2><a name="downloading-the-files-separately">Downloading the files separately</a></h2>
<p>The decimal module itself is just one file: decimal.py, which you can
download from the Python CVS:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/python/python/dist/src/Lib/decimal.py">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/python/python/dist/src/Lib/decimal.py</a></blockquote>
<p>You can use any browser, or utility programs such as curl, wget, etc, to
download this decimal.py file to some location on your machine.</p>
<p>You must then copy this file into your Python installation
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></tt> directory (for example, depending on your platform and
exactly how you installed Python 2.3,
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">C:\Python23\FIXME\site-packages</span></tt> or
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/python2.3/site-packages</span></tt>). Note that you may need
administrator privileges to put the file there, which may mean, as
explained previously in this document, using <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">su</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span></tt> or other
means yet as appropriate to your installation.</p>
<p>On MacOSX 10.3, Python 2.3 is part of the operating system and is an OSX
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">framework</span></tt> -- but if you work at the Terminal, which basically means
at the BSD Unix level underlying MacOSX, you can still treat it as a
directory, and (typically with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">sudo</span></tt> from a user who is an
administrator, since <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">root</span></tt> is normally not enabled in a good MacOSX
installation) copy <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal.py</span></tt> into the rather long &quot;directory path&quot;
named:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/lib/python2.3/site-packages
</pre>
<p>Whenever you install anything it's always a good idea to test whatever
you have just installed.  To test the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimal.py</span></tt> installation you
need additional files: <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">test_decimal.py</span></tt> and all of the test files
(inside a directory), that you can also download from the Python CVS
repository:</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference" href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/python/python/dist/src/Lib/test/test_decimal.py">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/python/python/dist/src/Lib/test/test_decimal.py</a>
<a class="reference" href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/python/python/dist/src/Lib/test/decimaltestdata/">http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/python/python/dist/src/Lib/test/decimaltestdata/</a></blockquote>
<p>and then you can proceed to the next section of this document.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="checking-that-everything-is-fine">
<h1><a name="checking-that-everything-is-fine">Checking that everything is fine</a></h1>
<p>If you chose to download and unpack an archive, in the directory in
which you executed the installer you'll already have a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">test</span></tt>
subdirectory. If you downloaded the files separately, or used a
self-executing installer format that doesn't come with the tests (so you
also downloaded the tests separately from CVS, as per the previous
section), you should have downloaded placed, in any appropriate test
directory of your choice, the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">test_decimal.py</span></tt> file and a
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">decimaltestdata</span></tt> subdirectory with data files in it.</p>
<p>In any case, go to that test directory and execute the tests with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python test_decimal.py
</pre>
<p>You do NOT need administrator privileges to run the tests, so it's best
to run them with a normal, non-privileged user (the tests can't break
anything, but &quot;least possible privilege&quot; is a key security practice).</p>
<p>You'll see a lot of messages while different module parts are tested,
ending with a message similar to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
OK
doctest (decimal) ... nn tests with zero failures
</pre>
<p>If there's any problem with the tests, please contact the developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h1>
<p>In the same directory which you entered in order to execute the
installer, you'll have a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">docs</span></tt> subdirectory.  Directory <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">docs</span></tt>
contains documentation in several formats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>HTML: Open the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">index.html</span></tt> file with your favorite browser.</li>
<li>TeX: The doc sources are in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">libdecimal.tex</span></tt> file (they
use the same TeX macros as all of Python's online docs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The .tex file was extracted from the Python CVS, and the HTML files were
extracted from the on-line Python documentation (modified to get all the
Decimal-related links pointing to the downloaded files).</p>
<p>You can also check the documentation online, currently at:
<a class="reference" href="http://www.python.org/dev/doc/devel/lib/module-decimal.html">http://www.python.org/dev/doc/devel/lib/module-decimal.html</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="acknowledgements">
<h1><a name="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h1>
<p>I would like to thanks to Alex Martelli for the help with these docs
and his gentle pressure in order to package this Decimal independent
distribution.</p>
