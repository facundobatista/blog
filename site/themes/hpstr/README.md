This theme is a quick port of the [HPSTR theme by Michael Rose](http://mmistakes.github.io/hpstr-jekyll-theme/) Everything that's good in it
is Michael Rose's fault, everything bad is mine.

Known Issues:

* Not all features of Nikola are tested.
* Galleries will work better when [Issue #1764](https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/issues/1764) is fixed.
* CDNs are not used regardless of ``USE_CDN``
* It doesn't yet support configuring the entry image in the frontpage
* It doesn't yet support posts with "feature images"
* It doesn't support USE_BUNDLES = True
