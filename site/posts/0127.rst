Cerramos la semana con las últimas tres citas de una serie que comencé hace meses. De casualidad (no es que las haya dejado a propósito), son de las mejorcitas...

    "Oh, read all Kahan has written, and if you emerge still thinking you
    know what you're doing when floating point is involved, you're either
    Tim Peters, or the world champ of hubris."
    "I find it's possible to be both <wink>."
    *Alex Martelli and Tim Peters, 20 May 2001 *

    The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable
    classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code
    -- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death.
    *GvR, 20 Mar 2002 *

    Here's another technique that is faster and more obvious but that is
    often avoided by those who mistakenly believe that writing two lines
    of code where one might do is somehow sinful.
    *Tim Peters, Python Cookbook*
