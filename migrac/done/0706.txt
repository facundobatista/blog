Muchas películas nuevas
<tags>

Se nota que le dediqué tiempo a la series, porque no vi tantas películas estos meses.

- `10 Rules for Sleeping Around <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1993391/>`_: -0. Una comedia de elaboradísimo enredos, bastante divertidas por partes, pero muy, muy mala.

- `And So It Goes <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2465146/>`_: -0. Comedia sencilla, medio touchy, pero nada que termine de valer la pena.

- `Jupiter Ascending <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1617661/>`_: +0. Mucha acción, tiros y persecuciones, más una chica y un chico, mucho lugar común, bah... pero estuvo interesante, especialmente por la mezcla de iconografías y explicaciones pseudocientíficas que daban :). Notable colección de actores conocidos, también.

- `Kingsman: The Secret Service <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2802144/>`_: +0. Como una de James Bond pero en joda. Divertida, pasatista.

- `Kon-Tiki <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1613750/>`_: +0. El hombre y sus obsesiones. Gran historia, maravilloso que sea verdad :) Muy bien filmada, aunque un toque lenta en algunos momentos.

- `Only You <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110737/>`_: +0. Comedia romanticona de mitad de los 90, deberían saber de lo que hablo. Así y todo está linda: Marisa Tomei y Robert Downey Jr. en Italia :)

- `Perfect Sense <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1439572/>`_: +0. Me encanta como muestra lo que pasaría en la situación hipotética que describe, más allá que no trata de explicarla, me encanta como está filmada, actuada.

- `Radio Free Albemuth <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1129396/>`_: -1. Con una trama rara, muy lenta, poco creíble, no me llevaba a nada, a duras penas terminé de verla.

- `Reservoir Dogs <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/>`_: +1. Un clásico absoluto, un Tarantino de pura cepa. Impecable.

- `Salmon Fishing in the Yemen <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441952/>`_: +1. Una hermosa historia, con el tipo de humor que me gusta, con unos paisajes increibles y buenas actuaciones.

- `Sleeping with Other People <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3165612/>`_: +0. Una comedia romanticona divertida.

- `Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/>`_: +1. Bien hecha, bien contada, con mil guiños, y con un detalle interesante (teniendo en cuenta que es una película, y que es de ciencia ficción): creible.

- `The Intern <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2361509/>`_: +0. Es una comedia simpática, bien llevada, buenas actuaciones y con ritmo.

- `The Signal <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2910814/>`_: -0. A nivel argumento con algo de sentido en una parte, pero demasiado volado todo alrededor, y el resto de la peli que simplemente no suma.

- `Transcendence <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2209764/>`_: +0. Con muchas partes demasiado fantasiosas, pero el núcleo del asunto da para pensar bastante; muy interesante para disparar puntos de vista.

Por otro lado, aparecieron toneladas de nuevas para ver. Me hice `un scriptcito <http://www.taniquetil.com.ar/homedevel/utils/get_trailers.py>`_ que va a una página en YouTube de FilmTrailerZone, donde hay una lista de muchos trailers, y te los empieza a listar hasta que llega a lo que había visto en la última corrida. Te da unos datos del trailer, y vos le indicás si querés que lo baje, o no, o pare de ofrecer trailers. Luego los baja. Todo por linea de comandos, claro.

Bueno, decía, encima que me hice ese script y estoy viendo más trailers (lo que redunda en más pelis anotadas), en esta lista hay algunas recomendaciones que me hicieron, más un par de títulos que saqué de alguna nota en un diario o revista.
